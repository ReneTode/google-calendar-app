# this app retrieves data from google calendar and creates a HTML file with it.
# the HTML file then can be used to view directly or as an iframe in HADashboard

# first you need to setup the google calendar component in home assistant.
# https://www.home-assistant.io/components/calendar.google/
# in the google_calendars.yaml in your home assistant dir you can find the cal-ID which is your calendarid
# the json file you need to get from the google site is your client_secret file
# in the environment where you have installed appdaemon you also need to have the google api client installed.
# pip3 install google-api-python-client
# for questions i refer to the forum, please use the appdaemon part from the forum so ill see the question.
