# google-calendar-app
an App for Appdaemon to show google calendar events in HADashboard

desciption for jow to use it is in the yaml file.

just add the directory to your apps directory from appdaemon and edit the yaml file  and follow the instructions in there.

this is/was still a work in progress.
in my system it worked, but i got a monitor, keyboard and mouse on the system that runs appdaemon.
the trouble rises when you dont have that and cant get to a browser screen.
